            The phases of Venus show that Ptolemy's model does not work.

            Ptolemy's model predicted a partial set of vissible phases for Venus. We now know this is false.

        <Question>
            What are Kepler's 3 laws of planetary motion?
        </Question>
        <Answer>
            K1. The planets move in ellipses with the sun at one focus.

            K2. Equal Area - Equal Time:
            . Equal area is swept out in equal time by a line connecting a planet to the sun.

            K3. The bigger the orbit size the larger the period. P^2 : A^3 for all planets:
            . The square of the orbital period (P) and the cube of the semi-major axis (A) are in a fixed ratio for all planets
